                <h4>Here is a list of topics proclaimed in <a href=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.intro.budd.html target="blank"">The Dhammapadda</a>, along with a random quote selected among the many available: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>I. The Pairs</strong> - Little though he recites the sacred texts, but puts the Teaching into practice, forsaking lust, hatred, and delusion, with true wisdom and emancipated mind, clinging to nothing of this or any other world — he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heedfulness</strong> - By effort and heedfulness, discipline and self-mastery, let the wise one make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.</li>
                    <li><strong>III. The Mind</strong> - Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city, fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom. Then, guarding the conquest, remain unattached.</li>
                    <li><strong>IV. Flowers</strong> - Not the sweet smell of flowers, not even the fragrance of sandal, tagara, or jasmine blows against the wind. But the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the wind. Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtue.</li>
                    <li><strong>V. The Fool</strong> - So long as an evil deed has not ripened, the fool thinks it as sweet as honey. But when the evil deed ripens, the fool comes to grief.</li>
                    <li><strong>VI. The Wise </strong> - Few among men are those who cross to the farther shore. The rest, the bulk of men, only run up and down the hither bank.</li>
                    <li><strong>VII. The Arahant or Perfected One</strong> - The man who is without blind faith, who knows the Uncreated, who has severed all links, destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil), and thrown out all desires — he, truly, is the most excellent of men.</li>
                    <li><strong>VIII. The Thousands</strong> - Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</li>
                    <li><strong>IX. Evil</strong> - Like fine dust thrown against the wind, evil falls back upon that fool who offends an inoffensive, pure and guiltless man.</li>
                    <li><strong>X. Violence</strong> -  All tremble at violence; life is dear to all. Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill.</li>
                    <li><strong>XI. Old Age</strong> - These dove-colored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumn. Having seen them, how can one seek delight?</li>
                    <li><strong>XII. The Self</strong> - Just as a single creeper strangles the tree on which it grows, even so, a man who is exceedingly depraved harms himself as only an enemy might wish.</li>
                    <li><strong>XIII. The World</strong> - Swans fly on the path of the sun; men pass through the air by psychic powers; the wise are led away from the world after vanquishing Mara and his host.</li>
                    <li><strong>XIV. The Buddha</strong> -  He who reveres those worthy of reverence, the Buddhas and their disciples, who have transcended all obstacles and passed beyond the reach of sorrow and lamentation — he who reveres such peaceful and fearless ones, his merit none can compute by any measure.</li>
                    <li><strong>XV. Happiness</strong> - here is no fire like lust and no crime like hatred. There is no ill like the aggregates (of existence) and no bliss higher than the peace (of Nibbana).</li>
                    <li><strong>XVI. Affection</strong> -  From craving springs grief, from craving springs fear. For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?</li>
                    <li><strong>XVII. Anger</strong> - Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.</li>
                    <li><strong>XVIII. Impurity</strong> - Just as rust arising from iron eats away the base from which it arises, even so, their own deeds lead transgressors to states of woe.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>XIX. The Just</strong> -  A monk is not an elder because his head is gray. He is but ripe in age, and he is called one grown old in vain.</li>
                    <li><strong>XX. The Path</strong> - Having slain mother (craving), father (self-conceit), two warrior-kings (eternalism and nihilism), and destroyed a country (sense organs and sense objects) together with its treasurer (attachment and lust), ungrieving goes the holy man.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>XXI. Miscellaneous</strong> - He who is full of faith and virtue, and possesses good repute and wealth — he is respected everywhere, in whatever land he travels.</li>
                    <li><strong>XXII. The State of Woe</strong> - The liar goes to the state of woe; also he who, having done (wrong), says, "I did not do it." Men of base actions both, on departing they share the same destiny in the other world.</li>
                    <li><strong>XXIII. The Elephant</strong> - When a man is sluggish and gluttonous, sleeping and rolling around in bed like a fat domestic pig, that sluggard undergoes rebirth again and again.</li>
                    <li><strong>XXIV. Craving</strong> - The craving of one given to heedless living grows like a creeper. Like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest, he leaps from life to life (tasting the fruit of his kamma).</li>
                    <li><strong>XXV. The Monk</strong> -  He who has no attachment whatsoever for the mind and body, who does not grieve for what he has not — he is truly called a monk.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>XXVI. The Holy Man</strong> -  Nothing is better for a holy man than when he holds his mind back from what is endearing. To the extent the intent to harm wears away, to that extent does suffering subside.</li>
